input format:
requesting ride
nyride.exe drivers.txt riders.txt output0.txt output1.txt output2.txt phoneNumber request
drivers.txt is the input file which contains all drivers' information. Your program should never change this file.
riders.txt is the input file which contains all riders' information. Your program should never change this file.
output0.txt is the output file where you print messages to rider or driver.
output1.txt is the output file where you print the updated drivers information, 
            thus this file should have the same format as drivers.txt.
output2.txt is the output file where you print the updated riders information, 
            thus this file should have the same format as riders.txt.
phoneNumber. Ideally this should be a phone number which corresponds to one of the riders in the riders.txt whose state is "Ready_to_request"; 
             but life is not always ideal, and how your program should cope with various phone number cases will be described in this section.
request indicates this is a ride request.
